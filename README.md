# Bangla Number Plate Detection using YOLO

A deep learning project for detecting and recognizing Bangladeshi vehicle number plates using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm.

## Overview

This project implements an automated number plate detection system specifically designed for Bangla (Bengali) number plates. The system uses state-of-the-art YOLO architecture to accurately detect and localize vehicle number plates in images. 

## Features

- Real-time number plate detection
- Optimized for Bangladeshi vehicle number plates
- High accuracy object detection using YOLO
- Easy to use Jupyter Notebook implementation
- Visualizations of detection results

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** - Object detection framework
- **Deep Learning frameworks** (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- **OpenCV** - Image processing
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
python >= 3.12
jupyter notebook
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/programophile/Bangla-Number-Plate-detection-using-YOLO.git
cd Bangla-Number-Plate-detection-using-YOLO
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements. txt
```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open `number-plate-detection-using-yolo.ipynb`

3. Run the cells sequentially to: 
   - Load and preprocess the dataset
   - Train the YOLO model
   - Detect number plates in test images
   - Visualize results

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of Bangladeshi vehicle number plates for training and testing. Make sure to prepare your dataset in the required format before training.

## Model Performance

The YOLO model has been trained to detect Bangla number plates with high precision and recall rates. Performance metrics and visualizations are available in the notebook.
